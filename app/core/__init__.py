# app/core/__init__.py

# This file can be empty if you're just using it to mark 'core' as a package.
# Alternatively, you could make some core components directly importable, e.g.:
# from .database import get_db, init_db_command
# from .decorators import token_required
# from .utils import allowed_file

# For now, let's keep it simple and empty, or just acknowledge its purpose.
# The individual modules (database.py, decorators.py, utils.py)
# will be imported directly where needed in other parts of the app.
